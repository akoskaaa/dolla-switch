# \$switch ðŸ’°Expression based switch branching.

_You can read this as dolla'-switch._

Javascript's `switch` is unfortunately not an expression, which means you can't use it as a right hand side of an expression or in places where you can only put a single value. Luckily, `$switch` can function as an expression.

## Why would I use this over `switch`?

## Installation

For now, you can only use this with node.js, or using a bundler, because it's not exposing any globals, but who are we kidding, it's 2020, you probably do this daily already.

```bash
npm install --save dolla-switch
```

## Examples

And \$switch also supports types through [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/)!
